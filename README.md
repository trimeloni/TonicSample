Tonic Sample

I was looking for a easy Micro-Framework for creating a simple PHP-API.
I wanted to be able to map url's to function calls that could easily return data in JSon.

After looking around, I decided to start try out Tonic: http://peej.github.io/tonic/

This project should be a created for testing a Tonic setup.  
I am not intending on showing how to use tonis with templates.
