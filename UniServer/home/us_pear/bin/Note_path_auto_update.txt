Pear batch files have hardcoded paths. These paths are automatically updated
when servers are relocated. For each new batch file added to this bin folder
two files (core_config_inc.vbs and core_functions_inc.vbs) require modification
as follows:

1) Edit file UniServer\uni_con\includes\core_config_inc.vbs
   Locate section '-- Pear
   Create a new unique constant and define full path of file to update e.g.

   USF_PEAR_BAT        = US_HOME & "\us_pear\bin\pear.bat"     '* Pear utility

2) Edit file UniServer\uni_con\includes\core_functions_inc.vbs
   Locate function us_init() and section === Pear configuration ==
   Add code to update file e.g.

   If us_file_exists(USF_PEAR_BAT) Then                                  'Only update if exists 
    Call us_file_search_replace(USF_PEAR_BAT,search_str,replace_str)     'Update pear.bat 
   End If

Note: The following batch files  pear.bat, peardev.bat and pecl.bat have been
      added to the above files you can use these as a template.
