Tonic Sample

I was looking for a easy Micro-Framework for creating a simple PHP-API.
I wanted to be able to map url's to function calls that could easily return data in JSon.

After looking around, I decided to start try out Tonic: http://peej.github.io/tonic/

This project should be a created for testing a Tonic setup.  
I am not intending on showing how to use tonic with templates.

I also included the UniformServer (http://www.uniformserver.com/) for an easy way for Windows Developers to run the samples.
To use Uniform Server with this project on Windows, it is already setup to load this project at C:\TonicSample.
If you want to run it in another location with the UniformServer, then you will need to update the location of the www folder in the Apache httpd.conf file.
